# Archive_management
This is a collection of small tools to help with archive management (files, hard disks, memory cards, data structures)

Compare_copies.R compares the csv lists of files created by iterate_and_list.py and creates the list of missing files and the list of copied files.

Copy_files will be usefull to use the missing files list and to copy the missing files.

Only_dirs creates an empty directory-tree copy in order to create a mindmap without the filenames in FreePlane.
Freeplane can then export to .mm format that is readable by Vym.
